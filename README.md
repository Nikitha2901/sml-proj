## Machine learning project to predict Bike demand based on metorlogical data. Models are imported from Sckitlearn, code is writtien using python. The feature engineering was done on dataset and also correlation heatmap was check to how features are influencing each other. Few features were dropped such as dew,holiday,summertime. The dataset was trained logistic,KNN,Random Forest, Boosting-AdaBoost. The best model for prediction was Random Forest.
