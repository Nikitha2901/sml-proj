## Machine learning project 
- Aim : Predict Bike demand based on metorlogical data. 
- Models are imported from Sckitlearn, code is written using python. Please use below format to run script :
  ```shell
     python <scriptname>.py
  ```
- The feature engineering was done on dataset and also correlation heatmap was check to how features are influencing each other.
- Few features were dropped such as dew,holiday,summertime.
- The dataset was trained logistic,KNN,Random Forest, Boosting-AdaBoost. It was trained on naive classifier for comparision with other models. The best model for prediction was Random Forest.
